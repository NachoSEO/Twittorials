Hi everyone! 👋

This app was created by [DataChaz](https://twitter.com/DataChaz) for [Ranksense](https://www.ranksense.com/) as part of the RSTwittorial series.

It is built in pure Python via the mighty [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) framework and helps you check [status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) and redirect chains in bulk!

It is deployed for free on [Streamlit Sharing](https://www.streamlit.io/sharing) and you can try the app by clicking on the badge below:

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/charlywargnier/http-code-checker-rstwittorial/main/app.py)

Building web apps is a lot of fun and I believe one of the best ways to learn Python! I hope this Twittorial will inspire others to jump on the Streamlit wagon and build their own Python apps! 🙌🐍🔥

**Streamlit is open source, easy to use, and currently the fastest way to build and share data apps with the world - No front-end experience required!*
